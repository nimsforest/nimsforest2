MAKE COMMANDS:
--------------

Setup & Installation:
  make setup             Complete environment setup
  make deps              Download Go dependencies
  make install-nats      Install NATS server
  make verify            Verify environment

NATS Management:
  make start             Start NATS with JetStream
  make stop              Stop NATS server
  make restart           Restart NATS server
  make status            Check NATS status

Testing:
  make test              Run unit tests
  make test-integration  Run integration tests
  make test-coverage     Run tests with coverage

Building:
  make build             Build for current platform (Linux)
  make run               Build and run

Code Quality:
  make fmt               Format code

Development:
  make dev               Complete dev setup & validation
  make ci                Run CI checks locally


NEXT STEPS:
-----------

1. Update repository URLs in all files:
   - Replace "yourusername/nimsforest" with actual repo

2. Configure GitHub Secrets (optional):
   - CODECOV_TOKEN (for coverage reporting)

3. Test the pipeline locally:
   make test          # Run tests
   make lint          # Run linter
   make check         # All checks

4. Push to GitHub and watch CI run:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline for Debian"
   git push

5. Create first release:
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release"
   git push origin v1.0.0


TESTING COMMANDS:
-----------------

# Test CI locally
make test          # Run tests
make lint          # Run linter
make check         # All checks
make fmt           # Format code
make build         # Build binary

# Test full development workflow
make dev           # Complete setup + test

# Simulate CI pipeline
make ci            # Run all CI checks

# Create a release (after tagging)
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Test release"
git push origin v1.0.0
# Then check GitHub Actions tab


DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:
-------------------

1. Debian Package (Recommended):
   wget .../nimsforest_VERSION_amd64.deb
   sudo dpkg -i nimsforest_VERSION_amd64.deb
   sudo systemctl start nimsforest

2. Binary Release:
   wget .../forest-VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz
   tar xzf forest-VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz
   ./forest

3. Build from Source:
   make setup
   make build
   sudo cp forest /usr/local/bin/


PLATFORMS SUPPORTED:
--------------------

✓ Debian 11 (Bullseye) and later
✓ Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and later
✓ Any Linux distribution (amd64, arm64)

Note: Only Linux builds are created. This is intentional as the
target platform is Debian. Multi-platform builds (macOS, Windows)
have been removed to keep the pipeline simple and focused.
